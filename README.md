# LSTC Calendar

Use the LSTC Calendar to classify dates using recurring patterns, such as 25-Dec being Christmas.

The Calendar can be used to model the following examples.

1. Every Day
2. Weekends & Work days
3. Annual Dates
   1. Christmas
   2. Boxing Day
4. Lieu Dates
   1. The Monday/Tuesday following Christmas or Boxing Day that falls on the weekend
5. Specific Dates
   1. 2024-03-29 (Good Friday 2024)
6. Bank Holidays
   1. 1st Monday in May
   2. Last Monday in May

Note: LSTC does not support Lunar calendars at present, such as Easter, Eid, Chinese New Year, etc.  These can be added as specific dates for each year, with little effort.

This project is part of the letsseethecode.com collaborative coding project.
